Feel free to create any new XMl file by copying the base xml files.


Test XMLs test intercactions between two entities

Be sure to change the initial count for each type. 
Be aware of the starting energy levels and position if you need an intercaction to happen. 

Document any weird findings with the XML here if there are any. 

XML has to be in the correct order...I think...
